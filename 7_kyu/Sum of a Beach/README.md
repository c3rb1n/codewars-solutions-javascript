# DESCRIPTION:

Beaches are filled with sand, water, fish, and sun. Given a string, calculate how many times the words `"Sand"`, `"Water"`, `"Fish"`, and `"Sun"` appear without overlapping (regardless of the case).

## Examples

"WAtErSlIde"                    ==>  1
"GolDeNSanDyWateRyBeaChSuNN"    ==>  3
"gOfIshsunesunFiSh"             ==>  4
"cItYTowNcARShoW"               ==>  0
